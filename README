NAME
    MMS::Mail::Provider - This provides a base class for parsing an
    MMS::Mail::Message object into a MMS::Mail::Message::Parsed object.

VERSION
    Version 0.06

SYNOPSIS
    This class provides a parse method for parsing an MMS::Mail::Message
    object into an MMS::Mail::Message::Parsed object for 'generic' MMS
    messages (or ones that cannot be identified as coming from a specific
    provider).

METHODS
    The following are the top-level methods of the MMS::Mail::Provider
    class.

  Constructor
    "new()"
        Return a new MMS::Mail::Provider object.

  Regular Methods
    "parse" MMS::Mail::Message
        Instance method - The "parse" method parses the MMS::Mail::Message
        and returns an MMS::Mail::Message::Parsed.

    "retrieve_phone_number" STRING
        Instance method - This method splits the provided string on @ and
        returns the first list element from the split, replacing any leading
        + character with 00. This seems to be the convention used by most UK
        providers and may work for other non-UK providers.
